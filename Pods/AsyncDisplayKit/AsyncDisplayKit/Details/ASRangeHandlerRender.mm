  // This code is tricky.  There are several possible states a node can be in when it reaches this point.
  // 1. Layer-backed vs view-backed nodes.  AS of this writing, only ASCellNodes arrive here, which are always view-backed â€”
  //    but we maintain correctness for all ASDisplayNodes, including layer-backed ones.
  //    (Note: it would not make sense to pass in a subnode of a rasterized node here, so that is unsupported).
  // 2. The node's layer may have been added to the workingWindow previously, or it may have never been added, such as if rangeTuningParameter's leading value is 0.
  // 3. The node's layer may not be present in the workingWindow, even if it was previously added.
  //    This is a common case, as once the node is added to an active cell contentsView (e.g. visible), it is automatically removed from the workingWindow.
  //    The system does this when addSublayer is called, even if removeFromSuperlayer is never explicitly called.
  // 4. Lastly and most unusually, it is possible for a node to be offscreen, completely outside the heirarchy, and yet considered within the working range.
  //    This happens if the UITableViewCell is reused after scrolling offscreen.  Because the node has already been given the opportunity to display, we do not
  //    proactively re-host it within the workingWindow (improving efficiency).  Some time later, it may fall outside the working range, in which case calling
  //    -recursivelyClearContents is critical.  If the user scrolls back and it is re-hosted in a UITableViewCell, the content will still exist as it is not cleared
  //    by simply being removed from the cell.  The code that usually triggers this condition is the -removeFromSuperview in -[ASRangeController configureContentView:forCellNode:].
  // Condition #4 is suboptimal in some cases, as it is conceivable that memory warnings could trigger clearing content that is inside the working range.  However, enforcing the
  // preservation of this content could result in the app being killed, which is not likely preferable over briefly seeing placeholders in the event the user scrolls backwards.
  // Nonetheless, future changes to the implementation will likely eliminate this behavior to simplify debugging and extensibility of working range functionality.
  
  // The node calls clearCurrentContents and suspends display
